## Scintillua Manual

Scintillua can be used in the following ways:

* Dropped into an existing installation of a Scintilla-based application as an external lexer.
* Compiled directly into your Scintilla-based application.
* Used as a standalone Lua library (Scintilla is not required).

These usages are discussed in the following sections.

### Drop-in External Lexer

Scintillua can be dropped into any existing installation of a Scintilla-based application as
long as that application supports [Lexilla][] 5.1.0 or greater.

Scintillua releases come with three external lexers in the *lexers/* directory: *liblexlpeg.so*,
which is a 64-bit Linux shared library; *LexLPeg.cxx*, which is a 64-bit Windows DLL, and
*LexLPeg32.dll*, which is a 32-bit Windows DLL.

#### Using Scintillua with SciTE

[SciTE][] is the SCIntilla based Text Editor. Scintillua can be dropped into any SciTE
installation version 5.1.0 or higher with or without administrator privileges.

In order to install Scintillua for all users (likely requiring administrator privileges):

1. Unpack Scintillua to a temporary directory and move the *lexers/* directory to the root of your
   SciTE installation, typically *C:\Program Files\SciTE\\* on Windows and */usr/share/scite/*
   on Linux.
2. Add the following to the end of your *SciTEGlobal.properties*:

       import lexers/lpeg

In order to install Scintillua for one user (e.g. yourself) without administrator privileges:

1. Unpack Scintillua to a temporary directory and move the *lexers/* directory to a location
   of your choosing.
2. Add the following to the end of your *SciTEUser.properties* on Windows or
   *.SciTEUser.properties* on Linux:

       import /path/to/lexers/lpeg
       lexilla.context.lpeg.home=/path/to/lexers

   where `/path/to/lexers` is the full path of *lexers/* from step 1.

**Win32 note:** if you are on a 32-bit Windows system, you will need to replace
*lexers/LexLPeg.dll* with *lexers/LexLPeg32.dll*.

With Scintillua installed, SciTE will use Scintillua's Lua lexers whenever possible (as
indicated in *lexers/lpeg.properties*). If a Lua lexer is loaded but you prefer to use a
different one, add to your *SciTEUser.properties* (Windows) or *.SciTEUser.properties* (Linux)
file a `lexer.$(file.patterns.`*`name`*`)=`*`name`* line, where *`name`* is the name of the
lexer you prefer. Note that Scintillua lexers have a "lpeg_" prefix when used with SciTE.

Scintillua's lexers support the following properties:

* `lexilla.context.lpeg.color.theme`: The color theme in *lexers/themes/* to use. Currently
  supported themes are `light`, `dark`, and `scite`.
* `fold.by.indentation`: Whether or not to fold based on indentation level if a lexer does not
  have a folder. Some lexers automatically enable this option. It is disabled by default.
* `fold.line.groups`: Whether or not to fold multiple, consecutive line groups (such as line
  comments and import statements) and only show the top line. This option is disabled by default.
* `fold.on.zero.sum.lines`: Whether or not to mark as a fold point lines that contain both an
  ending and starting fold point. For example, `} else {` would be marked as a fold point. This
  option is disabled by default.

If you get incorrect or no syntax highlighting, check the following:

1. Does the language in question have a Lua lexer in Scintillua's *lexers/* directory? If not,
   you will have to [write one][].
2. Does Scintillua's *lexers/lpeg.properties* have your language's file extension defined? If
   not, add it to the `file.patterns.`*`name`* property.
3. Does the file extension recognized in Scintillua's *lexers/lpeg.properties* correspond to
   the language in question? If not, add or re-assign it to the appropriate Lua lexer.

Feel free to [contribute][] new lexers, as well as submit corrections, updates, or additions
to file types.

**Note:** any Scintilla lexer-specific features in SciTE will not work in Scintillua's lexers.
These include, but are not limited to:

* Style, keyword, and folding properties in *\*.properties* files.
* Python colon matching.
* HTML/XML tag auto-completion.

#### Using Scintillua with Other Apps

In order to drop Scintillua into any other existing installation of a Scintilla-based application
that supports the Lexilla protocol, that application must allow you to:

* Define the location of Scintillua's *LexLPeg.dll* (Windows) or *liblexlpeg.so* (Linux) library.
* Specify the path to Scintillua's *lexers/* via an internal call to the Lexilla protocol's
  `SetLibraryProperty()` function using the "lpeg.home" key.

Scintillua's lexers support the following properties:

* `lexer.lpeg.color.theme`: The color theme in *lexers/themes/* to use.  Currently supported
  themes are `light`, `dark`, and `scite`. Note that Scintillua cannot set styles by itself. Your
  application must allow Scintillua to do so via Scintillua's [SCI_GETDIRECTFUNCTION][] and
  [SCI_SETDOCPOINTER][] [API][] calls. Otherwise, your application can [read][] from SciTE-style
  style definitions generated by Scintillua and manually set styles.
* `fold`: Whether or not folding is enabled for the lexers that support it. This option is
  disabled by default. Set to `1` to enable.
* `fold.by.indentation`: Whether or not to fold based on indentation level if a lexer does not
  have a folder. Some lexers automatically enable this option. It is disabled by default. Set to
  `1` to enable.
* `fold.line.groups`: Whether or not to fold multiple, consecutive line groups (such as line
  comments and import statements) and only show the top line. This option is disabled by
  default. Set to `1` to enable.
* `fold.on.zero.sum.lines`: Whether or not to mark as a fold point lines that contain both an
  ending and starting fold point. For example, `} else {` would be marked as a fold point. This
  option is disabled by default. Set to `1` to enable.
* `fold.compact`: Whether or not blank lines after an ending fold point are included in that
  fold. This option is disabled by default. Set to `1` to enable.

### Compiling Scintillua Directly into an App

You can compile Scintillua directly (statically) into your Scintilla-based application by:

1. Adding *LexLPeg.h* and *LexLPeg.cxx* to your project's sources.
2. Downloading and adding [Lua][] and [LPeg][] to your project's sources.  Scintillua supports
   Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.
3. Adding infrastructure to build Lua, LPeg, *LexLPeg.cxx*, and link them all into your
   application.

Here is a sample portion of a *Makefile* with Lua 5.3 as an example:

    # ...

    SCI_FLAGS = [flags used to compile Scintilla]
    SCINTILLUA_LEXER = LexLPeg.o
    SCINTILLUA_SRC = scintillua/LexLPeg.cxx
    LUA_FLAGS = -Iscintillua/lua/src
    LUA_OBJS = lapi.o lcode.o lctype.o ldebug.o ldo.o ldump.o lfunc.o lgc.o linit.o llex.o lmem.o \
      lobject.o lopcodes.o lparser.o lstate.o lstring.o ltable.o ltm.o lundump.o lvm.o lzio.o \
      lauxlib.o lbaselib.o lbitlib.o lcorolib.o ldblib.o liolib.o lmathlib.o loadlib.o loslib.o \
      lstrlib.o ltablib.o lutf8lib.o \
      lpcap.o lpcode.o lpprint.o lptree.o lpvm.o
    LUA_SRCS = scintillua/lua/src/*.c scintillua/lua/src/lib/*.c
    $(SCINTILLUA_LEXER): $(SCINTILLUA_SRC)
    	g++ $(SCI_FLAGS) $(LUA_FLAGS) -DNO_SCITE -c $< -o $@
    $(LUA_OBJS): $(LUA_SRCS)
    	gcc $(LUA_FLAGS) $(INCLUDEDIRS) -c $^

    # ...

    [your app]: [your dependencies] $(SCINTILLUA_LEXER) $(LUA_OBJS)

**Win32 note:** when cross-compiling for Windows statically, you will need to pass `-DNO_DLL`
when compiling *LexLPeg.cxx*.

In order to use Scintillua's lexers in your application:

1. Call Scintillua's `SetLibraryProperty()` with "lpeg.home" as the key and the path to
   Scintillua's *lexers/* directory as the value.
2. Optionally call `SetLibraryProperty()` with "lpeg.color.theme" as the key and one of the
   theme names in Scintillua's *lexers/themes/* directory as the value. You can omit this call
   if you want to manage Scintilla styles yourself.
3. Call Scintillua's `CreateLexer()` with either `NULL` or the name of a Lua lexer to use in
   your application.
4. Call [Scintilla's SCI_SETILEXER][], passing the lexer returned in step 3.
5. If you called `CreateLexer()` with `NULL`, then call Scintillua's [SCI_SETILEXER][] [API][]
   to use the given Lua lexer in your application.

For example, using the GTK platform:

    SetLibraryProperty("lpeg.home", "/path/to/lexers/");
    SetLibraryProperty("lpeg.color.theme", "light");
    ILEXER5* lua_lexer = CreateLexer("lua");
    GtkWidget *sci = scintilla_new();
    send_scintilla_message(SCINTILLA(sci), SCI_SETILEXER, 0, (sptr_t)lua_lexer);

For more information on how to communicate with Scintillua, including how to work with styles,
please see the [API][] Documentation.

### Using Scintillua as a Lua Library

In order to use Scintillua as a Lua library, simply place the *lexers/* directory in your Lua
path (or modify Lua's `package.path` accordingly), `require()` the `lexer` library, [`load()`][]
a lexer, and call that lexer's [`lex()`][] function. Here is an example interactive Lua session
doing this:

    $> lua
    Lua 5.1.4  Copyright (C) 1994-2008 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
    > lexer_path = '/home/mitchell/code/scintillua/lexers/?.lua'
    > package.path = package.path .. ';' .. lexer_path
    > c = require('lexer').load('ansi_c')
    > tokens = c:lex('int void main() { return 0; }')
    > for i = 1, #tokens, 2 do print(tokens[i], tokens[i+1]) end
