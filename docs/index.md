## Introduction

Scintillua adds dynamic [Lua][] [LPeg][] lexers to [Scintilla][]. It is the quickest way to
add new or customized syntax highlighting and code folding for programming languages to any
Scintilla-based text editor or IDE. Scintillua was designed to be dropped into or compiled with
any Scintilla environment.

Scintillua may also be used as a standalone Lua library for obtaining syntax highlighting
information of source code snippets. Scintilla is not required in that case.

[LPeg]: http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html

## Features

* Drop-in installation in most Scintilla environments -- no modifications to Scintilla are
  necessary.
* Support for [over 120][] programming languages.
* Easy lexer embedding for multi-language lexers.
* Universal color themes.
* Comparable speed to native Scintilla/Lexilla lexers.
* Can be used as a standalone Lua library (Scintilla is not required).

## Requirements

Scintillua requires Scintilla 5.0.1 or greater and [Lexilla][] 5.1.0 or greater for a drop-in
installation. The drop-in external lexer already has Lua and LPeg pre-compiled into it.

When used as a standalone Lua library, Scintillua requires Lua 5.1 or greater and [LPeg][]
1.0.0 or greater. Scintilla is not required.

## Installation and Usage

Scintillua comes with a [user manual][] in its *docs/* directory. It covers how to drop Scintillua
into an existing installation of a Scintilla-based application, how to compile Scintillua into
your Scintilla-based application, and how to use Scintillua as a standalone Lua library.

As an example, you can drop Scintillua into an existing installation of [SciTE][], the SCIntilla
based Text Editor, by moving Scintillua's *lexers/* directory into SciTE's installation directory,
and then adding the following to your *SciTEUser.properties* (Windows), *.SciTEUser.properties*
(Linux), or *SciTEGlobal.properties* (either) file:

    import lexers/lpeg

Scintillua's Application Programming Interface [(API) documentation][] is also located in
*docs/*. It provides information on how your Scintilla-based application can utilize Scintillua
and communicate with it, and also how to write and utilize Lua lexers.

## Compile

Scintillua can be built as an external Scintilla lexer, or it can be built directly into a
Scintilla-based application. The standalone Lua library does not need to be compiled.

Scintillua currently only builds on Linux and BSD, though it can be cross-compiled for Windows.

Requirements:

* [GNU C compiler][] (*gcc*) 7.1+ (circa mid-2017)
* [mingw-w64][] 5.0+ with GCC 7.1+ when cross-compiling for Windows.

In order to build the external lexer:

1. Place a copy of Scintilla in the root directory of Scintillua (the Scintilla directory should
   be called *scintilla/*).
2. Place a copy of Lexilla in the root directory of Scintillua (the Lexilla directory should
   be called *lexilla/*).
3. Run `make` or `make win`.
4. The external lexer is either *lexers/liblexlpeg.so* or *lexers/LexLPeg.dll*.

For more information on compiling Scintillua, including how to compile Scintillua directly into
your Scintilla-based application please see the [manual][].
